Violence is one of the most primary and controversial issues in today’s society  And true that violence is on the rise  A major concern for many parents is the violence within television shows and movies, and the effect on children’s aggression  I particularly do not believe that violence in television affects children’s aggression, but who am I to say such a thing, for I am not a qualified psychologist  But I have many reasons for my accusation and references to back it up  Now television plays a major role in today’s society, and it occupies almost every home in the United States  Parents have such a big concern for the children watching television, but children throughout the U S watch an average of twenty hours of television  So I posted the first question  Who allows these children to watch so much television  Obvious question answered with the complainers 
Many studies show that television does have an effect on children’s aggression, but also on their knowledge, and their ability to decide from right and wrong  In a certain study, researched showed that young boys who watched non-violent television tend to be more aggressive than boys who watch violent television  Another point is that violence is apparent regardless where it comes from, whether it is from cartoons, movies, or the news  So take away all the shows and movies that incorporate violence, what’s left  The news, which shows the most drastic and real violence that, is apparent to everyone even if you do not watch it  It still affects everyone  But let’s look at the big picture  Cartoons play the majority of the role  They have been around for centuries  So why make such a big deal about them now  Are the cartoons in earlier years any different from newer cartoons  Yes, I agree, but there is a purpose 
The Monaco 2 newer cartoons attract the newer generation  If parents say that cartoons now are more violent than those of earlier years than why are there so many, and so many different ratings accompanied with the beginning of every show  What about «Bugs Bunny» and «Daffy Duck» with «Elmer Fudd,» and how many fights and hunting scenes there was  What about «Road Runner» and how many times «Wylie Coyote» tried to kill him  All these cartoons amused many children in earlier years and present years  So why start complaining now  Can parents not control their children  Maybe parents should pay more close attention to what their children watch, instead of making excuses and blaming others for practically their own decisions  Because it was their decision to have children, right.
