Violence is one of the most primary and controversial issues in todayís society  And true that violence is on the rise  A major concern for many parents is the violence within television shows and movies, and the effect on childrenís aggression  I particularly do not believe that violence in television affects childrenís aggression, but who am I to say such a thing, for I am not a qualified psychologist  But I have many reasons for my accusation and references to back it up  Now television plays a major role in todayís society, and it occupies almost every home in the United States  Parents have such a big concern for the children watching television, but children throughout the U S watch an average of twenty hours of television  So I posted the first question  Who allows these children to watch so much television  Obvious question answered with the complainers 
Many studies show that television does have an effect on childrenís aggression, but also on their knowledge, and their ability to decide from right and wrong  In a certain study, researched showed that young boys who watched non-violent television tend to be more aggressive than boys who watch violent television  Another point is that violence is apparent regardless where it comes from, whether it is from cartoons, movies, or the news  So take away all the shows and movies that incorporate violence, whatís left  The news, which shows the most drastic and real violence that, is apparent to everyone even if you do not watch it  It still affects everyone  But letís look at the big picture  Cartoons play the majority of the role  They have been around for centuries  So why make such a big deal about them now  Are the cartoons in earlier years any different from newer cartoons  Yes, I agree, but there is a purpose 
The Monaco 2 newer cartoons attract the newer generation  If parents say that cartoons now are more violent than those of earlier years than why are there so many, and so many different ratings accompa.
Violence 7
is 8
one 1
of 5
the 19
most 2
primary 1
and 11
controversial 1
issues 1
in 6
today 2
s 8
society 2
And 11
true 1
that 8
violence 7
is 8
on 4
the 19
rise 1
A 8
major 2
concern 2
for 5
many 5
parents 3
is 8
the 19
violence 7
within 1
television 9
shows 3
and 11
movies 3
and 11
the 19
effect 2
on 4
children 6
s 8
aggression 3
I 6
particularly 1
do 2
not 3
believe 1
that 8
violence 7
in 6
television 9
affects 2
children 6
s 8
aggression 3
but 6
who 4
am 2
I 6
to 6
say 2
such 3
a 8
thing 1
for 5
I 6
am 2
not 3
a 8
qualified 1
psychologist 1
But 6
I 6
have 4
many 5
reasons 1
for 5
my 1
accusation 1
and 11
references 1
to 6
back 1
it 6
up 1
Now 3
television 9
plays 1
a 8
major 2
role 2
in 6
today 2
s 8
society 2
and 11
it 6
occupies 1
almost 1
every 1
home 1
in 6
the 19
United 1
States 1
Parents 3
have 4
such 3
a 8
big 3
concern 2
for 5
the 19
children 6
watching 1
television 9
but 6
children 6
throughout 1
the 19
U 1
S 8
watch 4
an 2
average 1
of 5
twenty 1
hours 1
of 5
television 9
So 6
I 6
posted 1
the 19
first 1
question 2
Who 4
allows 1
these 1
children 6
to 6
watch 4
so 6
much 1
television 9
Obvious 1
question 2
answered 1
with 1
the 19
complainers 1
Many 5
studies 1
show 1
that 8
television 9
does 1
have 4
an 2
effect 2
on 4
children 6
s 8
aggression 3
but 6
also 1
on 4
their 2
knowledge 1
and 11
their 2
ability 1
to 6
decide 1
from 4
right 1
and 11
wrong 1
In 6
a 8
certain 1
study 1
researched 1
showed 1
that 8
young 1
boys 2
who 4
watched 1
non 1
violent 3
television 9
tend 1
to 6
be 1
more 2
aggressive 1
than 3
boys 2
who 4
watch 4
violent 3
television 9
Another 1
point 1
is 8
that 8
violence 7
is 8
apparent 2
regardless 1
where 1
it 6
comes 1
from 4
whether 1
it 6
is 8
from 4
cartoons 6
movies 3
or 1
the 19
news 2
So 6
take 1
away 1
all 1
the 19
shows 3
and 11
movies 3
that 8
incorporate 1
violence 7
what 1
s 8
left 1
The 19
news 2
which 1
shows 3
the 19
most 2
drastic 1
and 11
real 1
violence 7
that 8
is 8
apparent 2
to 6
everyone 2
even 1
if 2
you 1
do 2
not 3
watch 4
it 6
It 6
still 1
affects 2
everyone 2
But 6
let 1
s 8
look 1
at 1
the 19
big 3
picture 1
Cartoons 6
play 1
the 19
majority 1
of 5
the 19
role 2
They 1
have 4
been 1
around 1
for 5
centuries 1
So 6
why 2
make 1
such 3
a 8
big 3
deal 1
about 1
them 1
now 3
Are 3
the 19
cartoons 6
in 6
earlier 2
years 2
any 1
different 2
from 4
newer 3
cartoons 6
Yes 1
I 6
agree 1
but 6
there 2
is 8
a 8
purpose 1
The 19
Monaco 1
newer 3
cartoons 6
attract 1
the 19
newer 3
generation 1
If 2
parents 3
say 2
that 8
cartoons 6
now 3
are 3
more 2
violent 3
than 3
those 1
of 5
earlier 2
years 2
than 3
why 2
are 3
there 2
so 6
many 5
and 11
so 6
many 5
different 2
ratings 1
accompa 1
